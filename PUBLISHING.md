# Publishing a Mod

> **First time publishing?** Use the hands-on walkthrough in **[TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md)** instead — it walks you through the same steps with concrete commands and example output. Come back here for reference once you know the flow.

End-to-end reference for getting your mod into the Maker Studio Marketplace. Skip ahead to whichever section you need:

1. [Repo layout](#1--your-mod-repo)
2. [Release convention](#2--release-convention)
3. [Signing with minisign](#3--signing-releases-recommended)
4. [Registry submission](#4--get-listed-in-the-registry)
5. [Updating](#5--releasing-an-update)
6. [Removing or renaming](#6--removing-or-renaming-a-mod)
7. [What users see](#7--what-users-see)
8. [Common mistakes](#8--common-mistakes)

The Marketplace is server-less: it reads this registry's `index.json`, looks up your mod's latest GitHub Release, and installs the zip you attached. You keep ownership of your mod repo. To get listed, you open one pull request here. After that, each new version is just a fresh GitHub Release on your own repo.

## 1 — Your Mod Repo

Your mod needs a `manifest.json` and at least one JavaScript file. A typical repo layout:

```
ms-my-mod/
├── manifest.json
├── index.js
├── README.md
└── (any assets you need)
```

### `manifest.json` minimum

```json
{
  "id": "com.yourname.mymod",
  "name": "My Mod",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "apiVersion": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "description": "What it does in one sentence.",
  "url": "https://your-site-or-handle",
  "permissions": ["ui.toasts"]
}
```

Field rules:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `id` | yes | Reverse-DNS, permanent. Cannot change once published |
| `name` | yes | Shown in Mod Manager and Marketplace cards |
| `version` | yes | Semver. Must match release tag (without leading `v`) |
| `apiVersion` | yes | Editor's Mod API version your mod targets |
| `main` | yes | Relative path to JS entry. No `..` or absolute paths |
| `author` | recommended | Display name |
| `description` | recommended | Long descriptions get truncated in the card |
| `url` | recommended | Author link shown in Mod Manager |
| `homepage` | optional | Separate from `url` |
| `dependencies` | optional | `{ "other.mod.id": "^1.0.0" }` — loader topo-sorts |
| `permissions` | optional | See [Permissions](#permissions) below |

### Mod entry file

A mod exports an `activate(ctx)` function and optionally `deactivate()`:

```js
export function activate(ctx) {
  ctx.log.info("My Mod loaded");

  ctx.ui.showToast({ message: "Hello!" });

  ctx.menu.registerMenuItem({
    menu: "Mods",
    label: "My Mod — Do Thing",
    handler: () => ctx.ui.showToast({ message: "Did the thing." }),
  });
}

export function deactivate() {
  // Disposables registered through ctx are auto-cleaned. Nothing else to do.
}
```

The `ctx` argument exposes the full editor API: `editor`, `map`, `tileset`, `events`, `tools`, `menu`, `commands`, `ui`, `bus`, `fs`, `storage`, `log`, `lifecycle`, `stats`, `keybinds`, `selectors`, `projectData`.

Two ways to learn it:

- Read the bundled example mods under [`examples/mods/`](examples/mods/) — every folder ships with a walkthrough README explaining what API surface it uses.
- Read the API reference docs under [`docs/`](docs/) — [api-reference.md](docs/api-reference.md), [events-reference.md](docs/events-reference.md), [quick-reference.md](docs/quick-reference.md). For IDE autocomplete, drop [`docs/mod-api.d.ts`](docs/mod-api.d.ts) next to your `index.js`.

### Permissions

Declared in `manifest.json#permissions`. Users see the list before installing.

| Permission | What it grants |
|------------|----------------|
| `fs.mod` | Read/write inside the mod's own folder |
| `fs.project` | Read project assets (game folder) |
| `fs.write.project` | Write inside the project (modify game data) |
| `events.cancel.save` | Cancel save operations via the `save.before` event |
| `ui.dialogs` | Show dialogs |
| `ui.toasts` | Show toasts |

Declare every permission you actually use. Undeclared usage is a red flag for reviewers and users.

## 2 — Release Convention

Each release on your repo must follow these rules:

- **Git tag**: `vX.Y.Z` (semver). Example: `v1.2.0`.
- **`manifest.json#version`** must match the tag without the leading `v`. If they disagree the editor refuses to install.
- **Zip asset**: named `<modId>-<version>.zip`. Example: `com.yourname.mymod-1.2.0.zip`.
- **Zip layout**: `manifest.json` lives at the zip root. Either zip the contents of your mod folder directly, or zip the folder itself — the installer auto-strips a single top-level folder.
- **Release body**: this markdown becomes the changelog shown in the Marketplace card.

### Building the zip on Windows

```powershell
Compress-Archive -Path manifest.json,index.js,README.md -DestinationPath com.yourname.mymod-1.2.0.zip
```

### Building the zip on macOS/Linux

```bash
zip -r com.yourname.mymod-1.2.0.zip manifest.json index.js README.md
```

Test before publishing: unzip into `%APPDATA%/maker-studio/Mods/com.yourname.mymod/`, restart the editor, confirm the mod loads in the Mod Manager.

## 3 — Signing Releases (Recommended)

Signed mods get a green **Verified** chip and skip the "I understand this is unverified code" confirmation step. Users are far more likely to install signed mods.

Full step-by-step guide: [KEYS.md](KEYS.md). Use the one-shot generator script:

```powershell
# Windows
.\scripts\generate-keypair.ps1
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux
./scripts/generate-keypair.sh
```

It installs minisign if missing, generates the keypair with the right filenames, and prints the pubkey line you need to paste into your registry entry.

### Per release

After building the zip:

```
minisign -S -s com.yourname.mymod.key -m com.yourname.mymod-1.2.0.zip
```

This produces `com.yourname.mymod-1.2.0.zip.minisig`. Upload **both** files as release assets on GitHub.

## 4 — Get Listed in the Registry

Fork this repo. Open `index.json` and add an entry to the `mods` array:

```json
{
  "id": "com.yourname.mymod",
  "name": "My Mod",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "repo": "your-github-handle/ms-my-mod",
  "description": "One-line pitch of what the mod does.",
  "tags": ["tools", "ui"],
  "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-github-handle/ms-my-mod/main/icon.png",
  "homepage": "https://your-site-or-twitter",
  "minStudioVersion": "2.0.0",
  "apiVersion": "1.x",
  "pubkey": "RWQyour-minisign-pubkey-here"
}
```

Open a PR. The PR template asks you to confirm: tested on the latest editor, no obfuscated code, permissions justified. Fill it in.

Once merged, your mod is live within one hour for everyone using the Marketplace.

## 5 — Releasing an Update

Per new version:

1. Bump `manifest.json#version` (e.g. `1.2.0` → `1.2.1`).
2. Commit, tag `v1.2.1`, push the tag.
3. Build the zip: `com.yourname.mymod-1.2.1.zip`.
4. Sign it: `minisign -S -s my-mod.key -m com.yourname.mymod-1.2.1.zip`.
5. Create a GitHub Release for the tag, attach both files, write the changelog in the release body.

Users get an "Update available" notification next time their editor checks (within an hour of you publishing). No registry PR needed for updates.

## 6 — Removing or Renaming a Mod

If you abandon a mod or want to take it down: open a PR to this repo removing your `index.json` entry. The mod stops appearing in the Marketplace, but anyone who already installed it keeps it until they manually uninstall.

If you want to rename or restructure: **you cannot change `id`**. Publish under a new id and ask users to migrate. Old installs of the old id are unaffected.

## 7 — What Users See

When someone clicks **Install** on your mod they see:

- Your icon, name, and author.
- A **Verified** or **Unverified** chip (based on your signature).
- The exact list of capabilities your manifest's `permissions` array declares.
- A Cancel / Install button.

Keep your `permissions` minimal — every extra permission scares users away.

## 8 — Common Mistakes

- **Tag doesn't match manifest version** → installer refuses. `manifest.json#version` must equal the tag without the `v`.
- **Zip wraps everything in a deep folder** → only single-level wrapping is auto-stripped. Don't zip `Documents/my-mod/manifest.json`.
- **Asset name doesn't include modId** → installer falls back to the first `.zip` it finds, but ambiguity invites bugs. Stick to `<modId>-<version>.zip`.
- **Forgot to upload `.minisig` after declaring a pubkey** → install blocked. Either sign or remove the `pubkey` from the registry entry.
- **Bumped manifest but forgot the tag** → users won't see the new release.
- **`manifest.id` doesn't match what's in `index.json`** → installer rejects with "manifest id mismatch".
